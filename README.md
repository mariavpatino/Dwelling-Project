## ABOUT

Realty based consumer database where information is combined from several data sources into a single searchable resource for homes and neighborhoods. 
This database displayed in a Web Page will seek to combine vital information like school system information, and commuter scores into a single searchable resource.

Technology Used:
- Python
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript
- Flask
- MongoDB <br>

<br>

### Dataset

* Zip Code, City and House Type: MLS web page (scraped)
* [High School Rankings](https://api.schooldigger.com/v1.2/rankings/schools/NJ?level=High&perPage=50&appID=4199a348&appKey=5d16139d9ca9a3a48f2e4d3ac749468f)
* [Transportation](https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d1b2669cd9bf4ab6bb8e04f5326e8d77_9/data?orderBy=COUNTY) <br>

### Project Steps:

1. Assemble list of available properties in NJ and characteristics from MLS (through web scraping).
2. Use the location parameters (lat, long) to obtain the relevant data from the other data sources  as commuter score and education). 
3. Combine all the data in MongoDB.
